# Weekly Report Template

**Week of:** YYYY-MM-DD

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- [ ] Goal 1: [Specific, measurable objective]
- [ ] Goal 2: [Another concrete deliverable]
- [ ] Goal 3: [Technical milestone]

## âœ… Shipped
- **v0.1 MVP**: Live dashboard with authentication and YouTube integration
- **Database Schema**: User, Campaign, and Metrics models with proper indexing
- **Connector Architecture**: Pluggable system for all major social platforms
- **Real-time Charts**: Interactive Chart.js visualization with daily metrics
- **ROI Tracking**: Campaign cost/revenue analysis and performance KPIs
- **Security**: NextAuth.js with credential provider and protected routes

## ðŸ“Š Metrics
- **Uptime**: 100% (Vercel deployment)
- **Ingest Success Rate**: X/Y successful API calls
- **Performance**: p95 page load < 1.2s
- **API Response Time**: avg XXXms
- **Database Queries**: avg XXXms

## ðŸš¨ Risks/Blocks
- **TikTok API Access**: Pending business approval (estimated 2-3 weeks)
- **X API Costs**: Requires paid tier ($100/month minimum)
- **Facebook Business Verification**: May require additional documentation
- **Rate Limits**: YouTube API quota (10,000 units/day)

## ðŸ”„ Next Week Priorities
1. **OAuth Implementation**: Facebook/Instagram Graph API integration
2. **Scheduled Jobs**: Nightly metric ingestion with error handling
3. **Campaign Attribution**: Link costs to specific content/campaigns
4. **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization and caching

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings
- **What Worked**: Pluggable connector architecture enabled rapid platform expansion
- **What Didn't**: Initial database migration issues due to missing unique constraints
- **Process Improvement**: Earlier API key procurement would have accelerated testing

## ðŸ“ˆ Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed ingestions
- [ ] Add unit tests for connector interfaces
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
